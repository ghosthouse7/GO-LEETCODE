## 📖 About This Repository
This repository documents my journey of mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms** using **Golang**. 
Unlike standard solutions, this collection focuses on:
- **Idiomatic Go Code** (Using pointers, interfaces, and efficient memory management).
- **Concurrency Patterns** (Goroutines & Channels where applicable).
- **Time & Space Complexity Analysis**.

My goal is to solve **1 Problem Everyday** to maintain consistency and deep dive into algorithmic thinking.

The solutions are organized by pattern/topic for easy navigation:

```text
📦 go-dsa-mastery
 ┣ 📂 arrays          # Sliding Window, Two Pointers
 ┣ 📂 strings         # String manipulation, Tries
 ┣ 📂 linked-list     # Fast/Slow pointers, Reversal
 ┣ 📂 trees           # DFS, BFS, BST logic
 ┣ 📂 concurrency     # Golang specific (Channels, Mutex, WaitGroups)
