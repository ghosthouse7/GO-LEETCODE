## 📖 About This Repository

This repository serves as a centralized collection of my **LeetCode solutions** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** implementations, written exclusively in **Golang**.

The focus of this project is not just to solve problems, but to write **production-grade, idiomatic Go code**.

## 🌟 Key Features

* **Idiomatic Go:** Utilizes extensive use of Pointers, Interfaces, and Structs.
* **Concurrency Patterns:** Solutions involving Goroutines, Channels, and Mutexes where applicable.
* **Performance:** Detailed Time ($O$) and Space ($O$) complexity analysis for every solution.
* **Unit Testing:** Comprehensive `_test.go` files for robust verification.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The codebase is organized by algorithmic patterns to facilitate easy navigation and learning:

| # | Problem Name | Pattern | Difficulty | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|:-:|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](./strings/longest_substring.go) | Sliding Window | 🟠 Medium | $O(N)$ | $O(1)$ |
| 2 | [Two Sum](./arrays/two_sum.go) | Hash Map | 🟢 Easy | $O(N)$ | $O(N)$ |
| 3 | [Merge k Sorted Lists](./linked-list/merge_k_lists.go) | Heap / D&C | 🔴 Hard | $O(N \log k)$ | $O(k)$ |
